\usage{
estimate_meta_I(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Three different types of inputs are accepted:
\itemize{
\item A \code{data.frame} with variables "y" for true labels and "r" for
confidence-binned responses. "y" needs to contain values -1 and +1 while
r needs to be a factor with ordered levels such that the first half of
the levels correspond to predictions for y=-1 and the second half to
predictions for y=+1.
\item A counts \code{table} with joint absolute frequencies. Rows correspond to true
labels (stimulus categories) and columns correspond to responses.
\item A contingency \code{matrix} with joint relative frequencies (as before but
normalized to sum up to 1).

\value{
Meta-I value (expressed in bits, i.e. log base is 2)
}
\description{
\code{estimate_meta_I} estimates meta-I, an information-theoretic measure
of metacognitive sensitivity proposed by Dayan (2023).
}
\details{
Meta-I is defined as the mutual information between the confidence and accuracy and is calculated as
the transmitted information minus the minimal information given the accuracy,
\deqn{meta-I = I(Y; \hat{Y}, C) - I(Y; \hat{Y})}.
This is equivalent to Dayan's formulation where meta-I is the information
that confidences transmit about the correctness of a response,
\deqn{meta-I = I(Y = \hat{Y}; C).}
It should be noted that Dayan (2023) pointed out that a liberal or conservative use of the confidence levels
will affected th mutual information and thus influence meta-I.

\examples{
# 1. prepare counts table for one subject
OneSbj <- subset(MaskOri, participant == 1)
y <- ifelse(OneSbj$stimulus == 0, -1, 1)
r <- factor(ifelse(OneSbj$response == 0, -1, 1) * as.numeric(OneSbj$rating))
counts <- table(y, r)

# 2. calculate meta-I
metaI <- estimate_meta_I(counts)
