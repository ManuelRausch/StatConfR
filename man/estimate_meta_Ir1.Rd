\title{Estimate Meta Ir1}
\usage{
estimate_meta_Ir1(x, ...)
}
\value{
Meta-I^r_1 value
}
\description{
Estimate Dayan (2023)'s information-theoretic measure of metacognitive accuracy meta-I^r_1.
This is meta-I (see \code{\link{estimate_meta_I}})
normalized by meta-I that would be expected from a signal detection rating model
}
\details{
$$meta-Ir1 = meta-I / meta-I(d').$$

Data can be input in three ways:
\itemize{
\item A data frame with variables "y" for true labels and "r" for
confidence-binned responses. "y" needs to contain values -1 and +1 while
r needs to be a factor with ordered levels such that the first half of
the levels correspond to predictions for y=-1 and the second half to
predictions for y=+1.
\item A counts table with joint absolute frequencies. Rows correspond to true
labels (stimulus categories) and columns correspond to responses.
\item A contingency matrix with joint relative frequencies (as before but
normalized to sum up to 1).
