#' Data of 36 participants in a masked orientation discrimination experiment
#'
#' In each trial, participants were shown a sinusoidal grating oriented either horizontally or vertically, followed by a mask after varying stimulus-onset-asynchronies.
#' Participants were instructed to report the orientation and their degree of confidence as accurately as possible
