# Summary
  
Cognitive models of confidence are currently used implicitly and explicitly across a wide range of research areas in the Cognitive Sciences to quantify discrimination sensivitiy and metacognitive ability. Here, we present the statConfR package for R, which allows researchers to conveniently fit and compare nine different static models of decision confidence applicable to binary discrimination tasks: the signal detection rating model [@Green:1966], the Gaussian noise model [@Maniscalco:2016], the independent Gaussian model [@Rausch:2017], the weighted evidence and visibility model [@Rausch:2018], the lognormal noise model [@Shekhar:2021], the lognormal weighted evidence and visibility model [@Shekhar:2023], the independent truncated Gaussian model based on the original meta-d′/d′ method [@Maniscalco:2012; @Maniscalco:2014; @Rausch, 2023], and the independent truncated Gaussian model based on the Hmetad method  [@Fleming:2017; @Rausch, 2023], the and In addition, the statConfR package provides functions to estimate meta-d′/d′, a widely-used measure of metacognitive efficiency based on both @Maniscalco:2012 and @Fleming:2017's model specification.
