Description: Provides fitting functions and other tools for decision confidence 
    and metacognition researchers, including meta-d'/d', often considered to be 
    the gold standard to measure metacognitive efficiency, and information-theoretic measures of metacognition. 
    Also allows to fit several static models of decision making and confidence.
