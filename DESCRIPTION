Description: Tools for decision confidence and metacognition researchers, including meta-d´/d´, often considered to be the gold standard to measure metacognitive efficiency.
    Also allows to fit several static models of decision making and confidence to test the assumptions underlying meta-d´/d´ and which may serve as an alternative when the
    assumptions of meta-d´/d´ do not hold.
