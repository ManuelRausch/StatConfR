\usage{
estimateMetaI(data, bias_reduction = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a \code{data.frame} where each row is one trial, containing following
variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{participant} (some group ID, most often a participant identifier;
the meta-I measures are estimated for each subset of \code{data}
determined by the different values of this column),
\item \code{stimulus} (stimulus category in a binary choice task,
should be a factor with two levels, otherwise it will be transformed to
a factor with a warning),
\item \code{rating} (discrete confidence judgments, should be a factor with levels
ordered from lowest confidence to highest confidence;
otherwise will be transformed to factor with a warning),
\item \code{correct} (encoding whether the response was correct; should  be 0 for
incorrect responses and 1 for correct responses)
}}

\item{bias_reduction}{\code{logical}. Whether to apply the bias reduction or
not. If runtime is too long, consider setting this to FALSE
(default: TRUE).}
}
\value{
a \code{data.frame} with one row for each subject and the following
columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{participant} is the participant ID,
\item \code{meta_I} is the estimated meta-\eqn{I} value (expressed in bits, i.e. log base is 2),
\item \code{meta_Ir1} is meta-\eqn{I_{1}^{r}},
\item \code{meta_Ir1_acc} is meta-\eqn{I_{1}^{r\prime}},
\item \code{meta_Ir2} is meta-\eqn{I_{2}^{r}}, and
\item \code{RMI} is RMI.
}
}
\description{
\code{estimateMetaI} estimates meta-\eqn{I}, an information-theoretic
measure of metacognitive sensitivity proposed by Dayan (2023), as well as
similar derived measures, including meta-\eqn{I_{1}^{r}} and Meta-\eqn{I_{2}^{r}}.
These are different normalizations of meta-\eqn{I}:
\itemize{
\item Meta-\eqn{I_{1}^{r}} normalizes by the meta-\eqn{I} that would be
expected from an underlying normal distribution with the same
sensitivity.
\item Meta-\eqn{I_{1}^{r\prime}} is a variant of meta-\eqn{I_{1}^{r}} not discussed by Dayan
(2023) which normalizes by the meta-\eqn{I} that would be expected from
an underlying normal distribution with the same accuracy (this is
similar to the sensitivity approach but without considering variable
thresholds).
\item Meta-\eqn{I_{2}^{r}} normalizes by the maximum amount of meta-\eqn{I}
which would be reached if all uncertainty about the stimulus was removed.
\item \eqn{RMI} normalizes meta-\eqn{I} by the range of its possible
values and therefore scales between 0 and 1. RMI is a novel measure not discussed by Dayan (2023).
}

All measures can be calculated with a bias-reduced variant for which the
observed frequencies are taken as underlying probability distribution to
estimate the sampling bias. The estimated bias is then subtracted from the
initial measures. This approach uses Monte-Carlo simulations and is
therefore not deterministic (values can vary from one evaluation of the
function to the next). However, this is a simple way to reduce the bias
inherent in these measures.

\details{
It is assumed that a classifier (possibly a human being performing a discrimination task)
or an algorithmic classifier in a classification application,
makes a binary prediction \eqn{R} about a true state of the world \eqn{S} and gives a confidence rating \eqn{C}.
Meta-\eqn{I} is defined as the mutual information between the confidence and
accuracy and is calculated as the transmitted information minus the
minimal information given the accuracy,
\deqn{meta-I = I(S; R, C) - I(S; R).}
This is equivalent to Dayan's formulation where meta-I is the information
that confidence transmits about the correctness of a response,
\deqn{meta-I = I(S = R; C).}
Meta-\eqn{I} is expressed in bits, i.e. the log base is 2).
The other measures are different normalizations of meta-\eqn{I} and are unitless.
It should be noted that Dayan (2023) pointed out that a liberal or
conservative use of the confidence levels will affected the mutual
information and thus influence meta-I.

\examples{
# 1. Select two subjects from the masked orientation discrimination experiment
data <- subset(MaskOri, participant \%in\% c(1:2))
head(data)

# 2. Calculate meta-I measures with bias reduction (this may take 10 s per subject)
\donttest{
metaIMeasures <- estimateMetaI(data)
}

# 3. Calculate meta-I measures for all participants without bias reduction (much faster)
metaIMeasures <- estimateMetaI(MaskOri, bias_reduction = FALSE)
