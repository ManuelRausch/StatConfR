	abstract = {Humans differ in their capability to judge the accuracy of their own choices via confidence judgments. Signal detection theory has been used to quantify the extent to which confidence tracks accuracy via M-ratio, often referred to as metacognitive efficiency. This measure, however, is static in that it does not consider the dynamics of decision making. This could be problematic because humans may shift their level of response caution to alter the tradeoff between speed and accuracy. Such shifts could induce unaccounted-for sources of variation in the assessment of metacognition. Instead, evidence accumulation frameworks consider decision making, including the computation of confidence, as a dynamic process unfolding over time. We draw on evidence accumulation frameworks to examine the influence of response caution on metacognition. Simulation results demonstrate that response caution has an influence on M-ratio. We then tested and confirmed that this was also the case in human participants who were explicitly instructed to either focus on speed or accuracy. We next demonstrated that this association between M-ratio and response caution was also present in an experiment without any reference towards speed. The latter finding was replicated in an independent dataset. In contrast, when data were analyzed with a novel dynamic measure of metacognition, which we refer to as v-ratio, in all of the three studies there was no effect of speed-accuracy tradeoff. These findings have important implications for research on metacognition, such as its measurement, domain-generality, individual differences, and neural correlates.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Human observers can reliably report their confidence in the choices they make. An influential framework conceptualizes decision confidence as the probability of a decision being correct, given the choice made and the evidence on which it was based. This framework accounts for three diagnostic signatures of human confidence reports, including an opposite dependence of confidence on evidence strength for correct and error trials. However, the framework does not account for the temporal evolution of these signatures, because it only describes the transformation of a static representation of evidence into choice and the associated confidence. Here, we combine this framework with another influential framework: dynamic accumulation of evidence over time, and build on the notion that confidence reflects the probability of being correct, given the choice and accumulated evidence up until that point. Critically, we show that such a dynamic model predicts that the diagnostic signatures of confidence depend on time; most critically, it predicts a stronger opposite dependence of confidence on evidence strength and choice correctness as a function of time. We tested, and confirmed, these predictions in human behaviour during random dot motion discrimination, in which confidence judgments were queried at different points in time. We conclude that human confidence reports reflect the dynamics of the probability of being correct given the accumulated evidence and choice.},

A substantial body of research has demonstrated that human metacognition is fallible but it remains unclear how metacognitive inefficiency should be incorporated into a mechanistic model of confidence generation. Here we show that, contrary to what is typically assumed, metacognitive inefficiency depends on the level of confidence. We found that, across 5 different data sets and 4 different measures of metacognition, metacognitive ability decreased with higher confidence ratings. To understand the nature of this effect, we collected a large dataset of 20 subjects completing 2,800 trials each and providing confidence ratings on a continuous scale. The results demonstrated a robustly nonlinear zROC curve with downward curvature, despite a decades-old assumption of linearity. This pattern of results was reproduced by a new mechanistic model of confidence generation, which assumes the existence of lognormally distributed metacognitive noise. The model outperformed competing models either lacking metacognitive noise altogether or featuring Gaussian metacognitive noise. Further, the model could generate a measure of metacognitive ability which was independent of confidence levels. These findings establish an empirically validated model of confidence generation, have significant implications about measures of metacognitive ability, and begin to reveal the underlying nature of metacognitive inefficiency.},

Are logistic regression slopes suitable to quantify metacognitive sensitivity, i.e. the efficiency with which subjective reports differentiate between correct and incorrect task responses? We analytically show that logistic regression slopes are independent from rating criteria in one specific model of metacognition, which assumes (i) that rating decisions are based on sensory evidence generated independently of the sensory evidence used for primary task responses and (ii) that the distributions of evidence are logistic. Given a hierarchical model of metacognition, logistic regression slopes depend on rating criteria. According to all considered models, regression slopes depend on the primary task criterion. A reanalysis of previous data revealed that massive numbers of trials are required to distinguish between hierarchical and independent models with tolerable accuracy. It is argued that researchers who wish to use logistic regression as measure of metacognitive sensitivity need to control the primary task criterion and rating criteria.},

However, in a backward-masked orientation task with a varying stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), we observed that confidence in incorrect decisions also increased with stimulus quality. Model fitting to our decision and confidence data revealed that the best explanation for the present data was the new weighted evidence-and-visibility model, according to which confidence is determined by evidence about the orientation as well as by the general visibility of the stimulus. Signal detection models, postdecisional accumulation models, two-channel models, and decision-time-based models were all unable to explain the pattern of confidence as a function of SOA and decision correctness.

            A fundamental scientific question concerns the neural basis of perceptual consciousness and perceptual monitoring resulting from the processing of sensory events. Although recent studies identified neurons reflecting stimulus visibility, their functional role remains unknown. Here, we show that perceptual consciousness and monitoring involve evidence accumulation. We recorded single-neuron activity in a participant with a microelectrode in the posterior parietal cortex, while they detected vibrotactile stimuli around detection threshold and provided confidence estimates. We find that detected stimuli elicited neuronal responses resembling evidence accumulation during decision-making, irrespective of motor confounds or task demands. We generalize these findings in healthy volunteers using electroencephalography. Behavioral and neural responses are reproduced with a computational model considering a stimulus as detected if accumulated evidence reaches a bound, and confidence as the distance between maximal evidence and that bound. We conclude that gradual changes in neuronal dynamics during evidence accumulation relates to perceptual consciousness and perceptual monitoring in humans.},

At the same time it has become increasingly clear that currently available quantitative tools are limited in their ability to make unconfounded inferences about metacognition. As a step forward, the present work introduces a comprehensive modeling framework of metacognition that allows for inferences about metacognitive noise and metacognitive biases during the readout of decision values or at the confidence reporting stage. The model assumes that confidence results from a continuous but noisy and potentially biased transformation of decision values, described by a confidence link function. A canonical set of metacognitive noise distributions is introduced which differ, amongst others, in their predictions about metacognitive sign flips of decision values. Successful recovery of model parameters is demonstrated, and the model is validated on an empirical data set. In particular, it is shown that metacognitive noise and bias parameters correlate with conventional behavioral measures. Crucially, in contrast to these conventional measures, metacognitive noise parameters inferred from the model are shown to be independent of performance. This work is accompanied by a toolbox (ReMeta) that allows researchers to estimate key parameters of metacognition in confidence datasets.},

Sensitivity and efficiency are often measured by quantities called metaâd0 and the M-ratio that are based on reverse engineering the potential accuracy of the original, primary, choice that is implied by the quality of the confidence judgements. Here, we advocate a straightforward measure of sensitivity, called metaâI , which assesses the mutual information between the accuracy of the subjectâs choices and the confidence reports, and two normalized versions of this measure that quantify efficiency in different regimes. Unlike most other measures, metaâI -based quantities increase with the number of correctly assessed bins with which confidence is reported.

Sequential sampling models offer two competing explanations for the relationship between confidence and response time: According to some models, decision time directly influences confidence. Other models explain the correlation by linking subjective confidence computation to the decision process dynamics. In previous model comparisons, drift diffusion-based confidence models that do not explicitly consider decision time in the computation of confidence provided superior model fits compared to race models that directly included decision time in the internal computation of confidence. In the present study, we present support for the assumption that confidence explicitly takes decision time and post-decisional accumulation time into account. We propose the dynamical visibility, time, and evidence (dynaViTE) model, an extension of the dynamical weighted evidence and visibility (dynWEV) model. DynaViTE assumes that confidence is not solely based on the final amount of accumulated evidence but explicitly includes time in the computation of confidence. Model comparisons using four previously published data sets with different perceptual decision tasks showed a good model fit of dynaViTE, indicating that the relationship between confidence and response time is not only due to the close link in the accumulation process but also to an explicit inclusion of time in the computation of confidence.},

	abstract = {Despite the tangible progress in psychological and cognitive sciences over the last several years, these disciplines still trail other more mature sciences in identifying the most important questions that need to be solved. Reaching such consensus could lead to greater synergy across different laboratories, faster progress, and increased focus on solving important problems rather than pursuing isolated, niche efforts. Here, 26 researchers from the field of visual metacognition reached consensus on four long-term and two medium-term common goals. We describe the process that we followed, the goals themselves, and our plans for accomplishing these goals. If this effort proves successful within the next few years, such consensus building around common goals could be adopted more widely in psychological science.},

	abstract = {Meta-dâ²/dâ² has become the quasi-gold standard to quantify metacognitive efï¬ciency because meta-dâ²/dâ² was developed to control for discrimination performance, discrimination criteria, and conï¬dence criteria even without the assumption of a speciï¬c generative model underlying conï¬dence judgments. Using simulations, we demonstrate that meta-dâ²/dâ² is not free from assumptions about conï¬dence models: Only when we simulated data using a generative model of conï¬dence according to which the evidence underlying conï¬dence judgments is sampled independently from the evidence utilized in the choice process from a truncated Gaussian distribution, meta-dâ²/dâ² was unaffected by discrimination performance, discrimination task criteria, and conï¬dence criteria. According to ï¬ve alternative generative models of conï¬dence, there exist at least some combination of parameters where meta-dâ²/dâ² is affected by discrimination performance, discrimination criteria, and conï¬dence criteria. A simulation using empirically ï¬tted parameter sets showed that the magnitude of the correlation between meta-dâ²/dâ² and discrimination performance, discrimination task criteria, and conï¬dence criteria depends heavily on the generative model and the speciï¬c parameter set and varies between negligibly small and very large. These simulations imply that a difference in meta-dâ²/dâ² between conditions does not necessarily reï¬ect a difference in metacognitive efï¬ciency but might as well be caused by a difference in discrimination performance, discrimination task criterion, or conï¬dence criteria.},

	abstract = {How can choice, confidence, and response times be modeled simultaneously? Here, we propose the new dynamical weighted evidence and visibility model (dynWEV), an extension of the drift diffusion model of decision making, to account for choices, reaction times, and confidence simultaneously. The decision process in a binary perceptual task is described as a Wiener process accumulating sensory evidence about the choice options bounded by two constant thresholds. To account for confidence judgments, we assume a period of postdecisional accumulation of sensory evidence and parallel accumulation of information about the reliability of the present stimulus. We examined model fits in two experiments, a motion discrimination task with random dot kinematograms and a post-masked orientation discrimination task. A comparison between the dynamical weighted evidence and visibility model, two-stage dynamical signal detection theory, and several versions of race models of decision making showed that only dynWEV produced acceptable fits of choices, confidence, and reaction time. This finding suggests that confidence judgments depend not only on choice evidence but also on a parallel estimate of stimulus discriminability and postdecisional accumulation of evidence.},
